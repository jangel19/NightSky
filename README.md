# NightSky

**NightSky** is a web application that generates personalized star maps based on a userâ€™s selected date and location. It recreates what the night sky looked like at a specific moment â€” ideal for commemorating lifeâ€™s most meaningful events.

## Inspiration

NightSky began as an **anniversary gift** for my girlfriend. I wanted to capture the exact sky from a special night and turn it into something timeless. What started as a small idea became a full-stack project that blends astronomy, design, and sentiment.

## Project Status: Version 1 Live ðŸŽ‰

The **first public version** of NightSky is now live and deployed via **Render**:  
ðŸ”— [Visit NightSky](https://nightsky-xutd.onrender.com/)  

Core functionality is complete, and the site is fully usable for generating star maps.  

Iâ€™ll continue updating and improving the project over time, with upcoming updates focused on:  
- Increasing **rendering speed**  
- Perfecting **template frame alignment**  
- Enabling **high-resolution downloads**

## Key Features

- Input any **date** and **location** to recreate an accurate star map  
- Customizable poster with editable messages  
- Star charts use real astronomical data  
- Built with a Python backend and image rendering pipeline  
- Clean, mobile-responsive UI
