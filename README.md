# NightSky

**NightSky** is a web application that generates personalized star maps based on a user’s selected date and location. It recreates what the night sky looked like at a specific moment — ideal for commemorating life’s most meaningful events.

---

## Inspiration

NightSky began as an **anniversary gift** for my girlfriend. I wanted to capture the exact sky from a special night and turn it into something timeless. What started as a small idea became a full-stack project that blends astronomy, design, and sentiment.

---

## Project Status: Beta

The first stable version is complete and live for testing. The core functionality works, and the project is now in its **optimization and enhancement phase**. I'm currently:

- Finalizing **high-res poster export/download**
- Improving **rendering speed** and **template frame alignment**
- Preparing for public **demo deployment**

---

## Key Features

- Input any **date** and **location** to recreate an accurate star map
- Customizable poster with editable messages
- Star charts use real astronomical data
- Built with a Python backend and image rendering pipeline
- Clean, mobile-responsive UI

---

## Tech Stack

- `Python` – core backend logic  
- `Flask` – lightweight API server  
- `AstroPy` – astronomical computations   
- `JavaScript` – client-side logic  
- `HTML/CSS` – responsive UI  
- `Vercel` – deployment (planned)

---

## Current Progress

- [x] Input form for date/location/message  
- [x] Star map generation with accurate celestial positions  
- [x] Responsive poster preview  
- [ ] Export as high-resolution image  
- [ ] Frame template rendering and scaling  
- [ ] Performance tuning

---

## Roadmap

- Add optional **constellation lines** and **planet markers**  
- Include **moon phase** and weather data (optional)  
- Offer **downloadable & shareable** links  
- Enable user accounts to **save and revisit** star maps

---

## Demo Preview

A live demo will be available soon. Users will be able to generate and download their own star maps directly from the site.

## Final Note

What started as a personal project has grown into something I’m proud to share. Whether you’re a romantic, a stargazer, or a developer — I hope NightSky brings some wonder to your screen. ✨
