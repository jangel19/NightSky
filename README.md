# NightSky

**NightSky** is a web application that generates personalized star maps based on a user's selected date and location. It recreates what the night sky looked like at a specific moment — ideal for commemorating life’s most meaningful events.

---

## Inspiration

NightSky began as an **anniversary gift** for my girlfriend. I wanted to capture the exact sky from a special night and turn it into something timeless. What started as a small idea became a full-stack project that blends astronomy, design, and sentiment.

---

## Status: Final Stages

The core functionality is complete and stable. Right now, I'm:

- 🛠 Finalizing **poster download functionality**
- 🐢 Improving **generation speed**, which is currently slower than desired for large outputs

---

## Key Features

- Input any **date** and **location** to recreate an accurate star map
- Custom poster layout with editable messages
- Generated visuals are based on real astronomical data
- Built with a Python backend and optimized rendering logic
- Clean, responsive interface for both desktop and mobile

---

## Tech Stack

- `Python` – core backend logic
- `Flask` – lightweight API server
- `AstroPy` – astronomical computation
- `Matplotlib` – image rendering and styling
- `JavaScript` – client-side logic
- `HTML/CSS` – responsive front-end layout
- `Vercel` – deployment (planned)

---

## Current Progress

- [x] Input form for date/location/message
- [x] Real-time star map generation with accurate celestial positions
- [x] Mobile-friendly poster preview
- [ ] Export/download as high-resolution image
- [ ] Optimize rendering and load time

---

## Demo Preview

> A live demo will be hosted soon. Users will be able to generate and download their own star maps.

---

## Roadmap

- Add optional constellation lines and planet markers
- Include moon phase or weather on chosen date
- Offer shareable image links or printable formats
- Optional login system to save star maps

---

## Note

This started as a personal project, but it’s grown into something I’m proud to share. Whether you’re a romantic, a stargazer, or a developer — I hope NightSky sparks some wonder ✨
